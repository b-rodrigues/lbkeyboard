Description: Tools for analyzing and optimizing keyboard layouts for
    Luxembourgish and other languages. Includes visualization of keyboard
    layouts, letter frequency analysis, and a genetic algorithm for
    finding optimal layouts that minimize typing effort. The effort model
    is inspired by Carpalx and considers finger travel distance, same-finger
    bigrams, hand alternation, and row changes.
