\arguments{
\item{text_samples}{Character vector of text samples to optimize for.
The algorithm will use character frequencies and bigram patterns from
these texts to evaluate layouts.}

\item{keyboard}{A keyboard data frame with columns \code{key}, \code{row}, \code{number}
(column position), and optionally \code{x_mid}, \code{y_mid} for coordinates.
If NULL, uses a default 30-key layout.}

\item{keys_to_optimize}{Character vector of keys to include in optimization.
Default is lowercase letters a-z. Only these keys will be permuted.}

\item{population_size}{Number of individuals in the population. Default 100.}

\item{generations}{Number of generations to evolve. Default 500.}

\item{mutation_rate}{Probability of mutation per individual. Default 0.1.}

\item{crossover_rate}{Probability of crossover. Default 0.8.}

\item{tournament_size}{Size of tournament for selection. Default 5.}

\item{elite_count}{Number of best individuals to preserve each generation. Default 2.}

\item{effort_weights}{Named list of effort component weights:
\itemize{
\item \code{base}: Weight for base key effort (default 1.0)
\item \code{same_finger}: Weight for same-finger bigram penalty (default 3.0)
\item \code{same_hand}: Weight for same-hand bigram penalty (default 1.0)
\item \code{row_change}: Weight for row change penalty (default 0.5)
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress every 50 generations? Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{layout}{Data frame with optimized layout including key positions and coordinates}
\item{effort}{Final effort score of the optimized layout}
\item{initial_effort}{Effort score of the starting layout}
\item{improvement}{Percentage improvement over starting layout}
\item{history}{Data frame with best and mean effort per generation}
\item{parameters}{List of algorithm parameters used}
}
}
\description{
Uses a genetic algorithm with a Carpalx-inspired effort model to find
an optimal keyboard layout for the given text samples. The algorithm
minimizes typing effort by considering finger travel distance, same-finger
bigrams, hand alternation, and row changes.
}
\details{
The effort model is inspired by Carpalx and considers:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Base effort}: Each key has a base effort based on:
\itemize{
\item Row penalty (home row easiest, number row hardest)
\item Finger strength (middle finger strongest, pinky weakest)
\item Distance from home position
}
\item \strong{Same-finger bigrams}: Very high penalty when consecutive
keys use the same finger (causes finger movement delays)
\item \strong{Same-hand sequences}: Moderate penalty, with inward rolls
(e.g., index to pinky) penalized less than outward rolls
\item \strong{Row changes}: Penalty for reaching between rows on same hand
}

The genetic algorithm uses:
\itemize{
\item Order Crossover (OX) for recombination
\item Swap, scramble, and inversion mutations
\item Tournament selection
\item Elitism to preserve best solutions
}

# Load sample texts
